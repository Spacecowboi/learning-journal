## The growth mindset and what that means to me

*Perserverance*
  "Don't stop." That is a phrase that I have told myself numerous times throughout the years in many diverse and adverse conditions. Many times when things get truly difficult and the future seems bleak, we tend to give up on ourselves. But it is in those moments that we have to pull ourselves up and drive on. 
  
*Have self-confidence*
  Having confidence in yourself can sometimes be the difference between moving forward or falling behind in many different scenarios. Particularly when it comes to doing something you ahve never done before. Self-doubt is the mind-killer and something that we should always try to recognize and eliminate from our thoughts. If you are reading this and know that you have these thoughts in regards to starting a new path, remember that sucking at something is the first step to being kind of good at something.
  
*Acknowledging fear*
  This sort of goes hand in hand with self-confidence, but there is something to be said about recognizing fear and how it affects your personal growth. Often times people will shut down in the face of adversity and tell themselves that it is attributed to a number of external factors that have nothing to do with what's really going on inside. The biggest obstacle is internal, and it is being afraid. Afraid of opportunity, afraid of being outside of your comfort zone, afraid of being in uncomfortable situations. Overcoming that fear is the biggest step to contiuing the journey of personal growth, and a key factor in having the proper growth mindset.
  
### Tips to remember how to stay in the growth mindset
- **Don't be afraid to ask questions**
- **Look at each failure as a learning opportunity**
- **Criticism can be your greatest tool**
  - Remember not to take things personally, especially in a professional environment
