# Notes on Computer structure and data

## How computers intake information
 - Input > Storage > Processing > Output

## Misc.
 - Computers transfer information through electricity via circuits
 - A simple circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it ( 1 > 0 )
 - Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
 - Computers use binary code, the most basic form of software using 1's and 0's to translate data and inputs
 - Any number can be represented with binary

## Adder/Other functions
 - The adder takes in two "bits", 1 or 0, and adds them to calculate the sum 

## Hardware and Software
 - Hardware includes: Circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, cards, power supply, etc
 - Software includes: Apps, games, websites, maps, databases, etc.
## The cpu is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
 - The cpu receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use
## Operating system
 - The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
 - Able to perform thousands of commands in a short amount of time
