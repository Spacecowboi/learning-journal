#JS Essentials

## Object
  - An object represents the entire webpage.

## Member Operator
  - Allows access to members of an object 
  

## Script
  - A series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.


## Misc. Notes
  - JS runs wherever it is found in the HTML.
  - When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script and then it checks to see if it needs to do anything.

## Tips on how to write a script for a web page.
  - Keep JS code in its own JS file. JS files are text files that have the .JS extension
  - The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JS file.
  - If you view the source code in the browser, the JS will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
