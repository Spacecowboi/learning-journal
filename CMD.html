# This will be the page for notes on the terminal and CMD console
- **Notes on the CMD line**
  - Quick rundown: For linux, the CMD line is just an addition to the GUI and not necessarily an overhaul. It's supposed to make life easier, but can be daunting without the right tools and knowledge
  - CMD line = text based interface to the system. The user inputs commands, and they are executed. 
  - Shell = What the terminal will behave like after you issue it commands.
  
### Notes on navigation (Terminology)
- PWD = Print working directory
- LS = List
- CD = Change Directory
