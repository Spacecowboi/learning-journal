# CSS Notes
  - CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
  - What is used to make things pretty and nice for the customer or viewer

## Block level elemtns look like they start on a new line.
 - examples include: h1, h6, p, and div
## Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line 
 - b, i, img, em, and span

# CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
 - CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
 - CSS properties affect how elements are displayed

## A CSS rule contains two parts:
 - A selector
 - A declaration
   - Selectors indiciate which element the rule applies to. THe same rule applies to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas. 
   - Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. They are split into two parts (a property and a value) and are separated by a colon.
