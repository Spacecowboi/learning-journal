# JS intro
 - JS allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content used in a web page while it's being used in the browser
 -You can do many things in JS, such as: Accessing content, modifying content, program specific rules and steps, and react to events.
  - Accesssing content: Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a vaule of email
  - Modifying content: Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
  - Programming rules: An animation can check the dimensions of the browser and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area
  - Reacting to events: A button is pressed, a link is clicked, an interval of time has passed, a web page finishes loading

# Defining a script
   - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. (for example, recipes, handbooks, manuals, etc)
   - A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts wit hthe web page
   - Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

# Writing a script
 - To write a script, you need to know your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
 - NOTE: A computer does not know how to perform tasks. It needs to follow instructiosn every time it performs the task. So a program must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were its first time.

## 1) Define the goal
## 2) Design the script
## 3) Code each step

## Expressions
 - An expression evaluates into a single value. There are generally two types of expressions:
   - Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
   - Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

## Operators
 -These allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
