# Learning the types of Version Control

	**Local VCS**
	**Centralized** 
	**Distributed Version**
 
 ## Git ##

- Lets multiple developers work on the same code
- A history of changes to your files
- The ability to view, apply, and remove those changes
- Keep all of your project files in one repo
- Makes collaboration possible

When using *Git*, "commit" is similar to "save as".

- Each commit (snapshot) has a label that points to it
- HEAD = "you are here"
- You can also assign messages to the commits *THIS IS IMPORTANT*
- Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot

## Git summary (poloaroid analogy)

- You use Git to take snapshots of your code at points in time
- Git keeps a history of what those snapshots look like
- Git has a special label, called HEAD that means "you are here"
- Usually you give a snapshot a label called a message


## GitHub (there is a difference)

## What is it?

- A way to share code with others (social media sort of for coding, minus the pictures and drama)
- A centralized location where developers from all over can meet and share code and work on open source projects
git + Github = yes

## Gitflow

A (Add)
C (Commit) *make sure you put a message 
P (Push)

## Useful inputs and brief descriptions of their functions

- git status = check file status
- git commit -m = commits changes and leaves a message
- git commit -a = commits all changes at once
- git push origin master = this pushes changes from the local master branch to the remote repository named origin
- git fetch [remote name] = this pulls new data to a local repository. particularly data you do not have from a remote project
- git pull = fetch and merge remote changes


**Remember that git status is not mandatory, kind of like a reminder for where you left off or if you can't remember changes, etc.
